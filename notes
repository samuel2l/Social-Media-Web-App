when trying to access assets from anywhere other than home route they probably will not load

eg at the http://localhost:3000/profile/safak route if this page is to display some images it will not work cos most images are just assets/your img
so when you go to a route like home page http://localhost:3000/ it can access the assets and display the imgs
can be visualised like so http://localhost:3000/assets
but for any other route the assets cannot be directly accessed
so to do this we store the http://localhost:3000/ in a var and use it everywhere you barb
so you can store it like this:REACT_APP_PUBLIC_FOLDER=http://localhost:3000/assets

so in every part of app we are using some asset we remove the assets/ and just leave the image itself eg /like.png
and we set up the app by simply concatenating the path with the public folder and the image

eg
const public_folder=process.env.REACT_APP_PUBLIC_FOLDER
<img className="shareProfileImg" src={public_folder+"/1.jpeg"} alt="" />
